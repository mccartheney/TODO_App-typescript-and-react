## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enhancing the development experience.
- **Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)**: A CSS preprocessor for more modular, maintainable, and reusable styles.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mccartheney/todo_app-typescript-and-react
   cd todo-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This will run the app in development mode, and you can view it in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## TypeScript Concepts Covered

This project covers several important **TypeScript** concepts, including:

- **Type Inference**: How TypeScript infers types from code context.
- **Interfaces and Types**: Defining types and interfaces for component props, state, and reusable objects.
- **React with TypeScript**: Using TypeScript for functional components, hooks, and managing the component state.
- **Typing Events**: Handling typed events such as form inputs and button clicks.
- **Optional and Default Props**: Understanding optional and default props with TypeScript.
